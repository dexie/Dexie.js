# Ng2dexie

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.24. Currently there are no E2E or unit tests in this sample project. The e2e and unit tests files were kept to make it easier to copy this project and extend it without having to later add configuration files for karma, protractor etc.

*NOTE: This sample uses a beta version of Dexie*
