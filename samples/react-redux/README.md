# React + Redux + Dexie Todo Example

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

*NOTE: This sample uses a beta version of Dexie*

The [redux-thunk](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk) middleware is used to handle the async calls of Dexie.

## Install dependencies

Before you can run the app in your browser, you will have to install its dependencies with:

```
npm install
```

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `build/` directory.
