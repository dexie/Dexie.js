# The app
The application stores a simple contact database using a relational database model, where each contact can have
0..n emails, 0..n phone numbers. Email- and Phone entries have their own tables and reference Contact through
the contactId index.

The AppDatabase class extends Dexie with the three tables **contacts**, **emails** and **phones**.
The tables are mapped to typescript classes and interfaces.

The sample shows how to subclass Dexie in typescript and define the tables.

It also shows how to map a typescript class to a database table and call methods on database objects.
