/* Minimal Service Worker for caching and background sync with Dexie Cloud
 * 
 * This service worker does two main things:
 * 1. Enables Dexie Cloud background sync by importing the Dexie Cloud service worker addon.
 * 2. Pre-caches and routes assets using Workbox for offline capabilities and faster load times.
 * 
 * The service worker is set up to log its build date for easier debugging of deployed versions.
 * It also uses `skipWaiting()` during installation to activate the new service worker immediately.
 * In a production app, consider allowing users to control updates instead.
 * 
 * Note: This file is part of a sample application and may be modified to fit specific needs.
 * 
 * See vite-config.ts for the Vite PWA plugin configuration that generates the final service worker.
