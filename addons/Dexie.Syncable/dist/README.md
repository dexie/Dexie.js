## Or build them yourself...
Fork Dexie.js, then:

git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Dexie.js.git
cd Dexie.js
npm install
cd addons/Dexie.Syncable
npm run build       # or npm run watch

```
If you're on windows, you need to use an elevated command prompt of some reason to get `npm install` to work.
