## bower
Since Dexie v1.3.4, addons are included in the dexie bower package. 
```
$ bower install dexie --save
$ ls bower_components/dexie/addons/Dexie.Observable/dist

## Or build them yourself...
Fork Dexie.js, then:
```
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Dexie.js.git
cd Dexie.js
npm install
cd addons/Dexie.Observable
npm run build       # or npm run watch

```
If you're on windows, you need to use an elevated command prompt of some reason to get `npm install` to work.
